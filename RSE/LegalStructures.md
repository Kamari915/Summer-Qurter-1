Hello World!

Social Enterprise Concept: NeighborNet

Public Benefit Corporation (PBC)
A Public Benefit Corporation (PBC) is the best legal structure for NeighborNet because it legally allows us to pursue both profit and social impact. It protects our mission of strengthening communities, lets us attract impact-focused investors, and builds trust through required transparency . Unlike a traditional corporation, a PBC ensures we can prioritize doing good not just making money.


The core mission is to empower local communities by fostering mutual aid, reducing inequality, and promoting environmental sustainability.

As a Public Benefit Corporation, NeighborNet can pursue social goals alongside financial sustainability without risking legal conflicts with shareholders. Our mission—community resilience through mutual aid—will be protected and transparent.
